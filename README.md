In this mini project, we defined a simulation of campus networks based on wireless networking. The network is divided into two sets: one for the campus area and the other for the hostel area.
The major aim of this project is to show the wireless connectivity that is used in universities to make the network efficient and mobile at the same time. Mobility is the major concentration of this project. To provide equal functionality to all the users (college staff and students), we have added DNS, Email, and HTTP servers for the maximum utilization of resources. 
Hence the campus network provides different services such as connecting the user to the internet, data sharing among users (students, teachers, and different university members), accessing different web services for different functionalities, so it needs wireless networking for smooth processing.
